# Self-Adjoint Prime-Shift Operators  
### Quadratic Forms, Regularization, and Arithmetic Dynamics

## Overview

This document isolates the **self-adjoint analytic core** of prime-shift dynamics
independently of any specific arithmetic conjecture.

It establishes when and how prime-shift operators admit **canonical self-adjoint
realizations**.

---

## Main Results

- Construction of regularized prime-shift operators
- Quadratic form framework
- Proof of closability and boundedness
- Friedrichs self-adjoint extension
- Stable resolvent behavior

---

## Role in the Program

This paper ensures that:
> prime-induced arithmetic dynamics is a legitimate spectral object.

Without it, trace formulas and spectral claims are meaningless.

---

## What This Paper Does NOT Address

- No explicit formulas
- No RH claims
- No L-function identification

---

## Status

**Foundational analytic work.**

---

## Relation to Other Documents

- Supports all SMRK Hamiltonian constructions
- Precedes trace and spectral identification

---

## Intended Audience

- Functional analysts
- Operator theorists
- Readers verifying mathematical soundness
